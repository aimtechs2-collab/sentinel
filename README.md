# Sentinel — AI-Powered Release Command Center

Flagship demo prototype for stakeholder screen recordings. Static dummy data with real LLM-powered agent responses.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (already done if cloned with node_modules):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment file and add your API key:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Add at least one key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   # optional fallback:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

3. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — sign in with any credentials to reach the dashboard.
