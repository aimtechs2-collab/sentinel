# Sentinel — AI-Powered Release Command Center

Built by release managers for release management.

Flagship demo prototype for stakeholder screen recordings. Static dummy data with real LLM-powered agent responses. **Live demo state** (Go decisions, deployments, notifications) persists in `localStorage` via the release store.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (already done if cloned with node_modules):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment file and add your API key:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Add at least one key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   # optional fallback:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

3. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — sign in with any credentials to reach the dashboard.

## Demo flow

1. Open **Quick Start** (`/templates`) and launch a scenario (e.g. auto-rollback, healthy green-path).
2. Record a **Go** decision on a release — it appears in **History**, **Notifications**, and **AI chat** context.
3. Use the bell icon for unread alerts; click **Audit trail** on a notification to jump to filtered history.
4. **Reset demo state** from the Templates page to clear `localStorage` and start fresh.

## Demo anchors
